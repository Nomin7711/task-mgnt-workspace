# Task Management System

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Nomin**, and I built this **Task Management System** following a **modular NX monorepo** approach using **Angular + NestJS + TailwindCSS + TypeScript**.

This system is secure and role-based, allowing users to manage tasks according to their **roles** and **organization hierarchy**. Below, Iâ€™ll walk you through how I structured, implemented, and secured this project.
